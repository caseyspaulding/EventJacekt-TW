## Data Access Layer (Data Access folder):

This is where all your direct database interactions occur.
It contains pure functions that perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on your database.
These functions are database-agnostic and don't know anything about HTTP requests, forms, or Next.js-specific features.
They can be easily tested in isolation and reused across different parts of your application.

## Server Actions:

These act as an intermediary between your UI and the data access layer.
They handle form submissions, process incoming data, and call the appropriate functions from the data access layer.
Server Actions can also handle Next.js-specific operations like revalidatePath for cache management.
They can perform additional logic such as data validation, transformation, or combining multiple data access operations.

## This separation provides several benefits:

Separation of Concerns: Your database logic is cleanly separated from your application logic.
Reusability: The data access functions can be used in various contexts - server actions, API routes, background jobs, etc.
Testability: Both layers can be tested independently. You can unit test your data access functions without worrying about HTTP or Next.js specifics.
Flexibility: If you need to change your database or ORM in the future, you only need to update the data access layer.
Scalability: As your application grows, this structure helps maintain organization and prevents your server actions from becoming too complex.
